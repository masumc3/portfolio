      <p class="pbox"> Hi, I am Masum and welcome to my page! I am a huge fan of basketball
      and love cars. I enjoy going to car meets and taking my car on the track. I am also
      heavily invovled with my academics and enjoy studying at the library.
      I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan studying
    in the BSI path. My dream is to become a software developer
  and learn how to become an industry expert programmer. I take great pride in
my field of study and believe that technology can solve many uncharted problems. Ever since
I was a kid I was always amused by the great things technology can accomplish. My interest has
only increased throughout the year. I always like to stay up to date with my gear as well. I prefer
to use Apple devices for the most part. I am a huge fan of Mac OS and hate using windows.

My current expierences include designing an app for high school students.
This app is inteded to facilitate interactions between the students for
extra curriculum activites and academic aspects. I also have expierence in
working at IT tech support.    </div>
