      <p class="pbox">Traveling is one of my favoirte things to do in the summer
        . I have been to London, California, Texas, New York, and Bangladesh.
       I have plans on adding more places after I finish my undergrad. One
      place I really want to visit is New Zeland. I would like to see the place
     where my favorite movie The Hobbit was filmed. I am a huge fan of scenary
   and love being outdoors. One of my favorite places that I have visited was
  in California, I really enjoyed San Francisco. Everything looked as if they
  were stacked on top of each other and the weather was just perfect. I have
  plans on moving there after my undergrad to pursue a job as a developer. </div>
