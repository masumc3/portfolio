      <p class="pbox">Traveling is one of my favoirte things to do in the summer
        . I have been to London, California, Texas, New York, and Bangladesh.
       I have plans on adding more places after I finish my undergrad. One
      place I really want to visit is New Zeland. I would like to see the place
     where my favorite movie The Hobbit was filmed. I am a huge fan of scenary
   and love being outdoors. One of my favorite places that I have visited was
  in California, I really enjoyed San Francisco. Everything looked as if they
  were stacked on top of each other and the weather was just perfect. I have
  plans on moving there after my undergrad to pursue a job as a developer. Yosemite
  was also an amazing place to visit. The views were breathtaking and I have never
  seen anything like it before. Pictures do not do justice, it is simply one of the
  best national parks in the entire country. England was also a great place to visited,
  I have tons of family there and the atmosphere of another country was great. I got to
  to go to many different types of resturants and went sight seeing. My favorite
  attraction was the Big Ben. I plan on visitng England again this summer and would like
  to visit the same locations and more. I believe traveling is a life essential and we
  should all travel more and see how amazing this planet is. A vacation can be very
  rewarding espically after working a hard years worth of work.</div>
