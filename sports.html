      <p class="pbox">I have always been a huge fan of basketball, it is where
        most of my freetime is spent. It helps me blow off stress and keeps me in shape.
        Regardless of watching or playing it is something that I enjoy the most.
        I played point gaurd for my high school and have always had dreams of playing for my University My favorite
        team has always been the LA Clippers. Despite the team not winning much
        I have always liked the culture of the team. My favorite player is kawhi
        Leonard. Another aspect of my life that has been limited becuase of the pandemic.
        No public gyms have open courts becuase it is a direct contact sport.
      I miss going to pickup games with my friends and waiting for all kinds of different
    talents show up. Latley I can only play outdoors but even that option will go away when it colds.
     The sport is not the same playing alone. However, I still get great pleasure
  playing period, but I cannot wait to reuturn to playing with others. My mental health
  has taken a great fall since basketball has been reduced so much out of my life. It is one
  of they key things that gets me going. I also cannot wait until I move to a climate
  that allows outdoor play year round.</div>
