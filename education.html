      <p class="pbox"> My education journey has started at Macomb Community
        College. I spent a year there and got all A's and was able to
      transfer to MSU. While at MSU I had the intention of pursuing a CS degree.
    I even took credits at Lansing Community College because they were not at MSU.
    I went to MSU becuase I did not think I can get into UofM. After I saw
    my academic success at MSU, I was encouraged to apply by friends. I finally felt ready
  to apply to my dream school UofM. The BSI degree really drew my attention and
  I was extremley excited when I got accepted. I am blessed with the
  the oppurtunities that I have had. Now in my senior year, I have enjoyed
  school so much that I have plans on pursuing a masters degree. The pandemic
has taken away the true expierence of school. Remote learning is no where
near as fun and I truly miss the organic aspect of an academic year. I feel
that my senior year was taken away from me and this might be one of the reasons
why I continue my education with a masters degree. Uofm has changed my life and
I miss many of my friends and the atmosphere of a great educational enviornment. </div>
