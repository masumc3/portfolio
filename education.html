      <p class="pbox"> My education journey has started at Macomb Community
        College. I spent a year there and got all A's and was able to
      transfer to MSU. While at MSU I had the intention of pursuing a CS degree.
    I even took credits at the Lansing Community College. I finally felt ready
  to apply to my dream school UofM. The BSI degree really drew my attention and
  I was extremley excited when I got accepted. I am blessed with the
  the oppurtunities that I have had. Now in my senior year I have enjoyed
  school so much that I have plans on pursuing a masters degree. </div>
